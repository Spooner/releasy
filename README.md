Releasy
=======

_Releasy_ automates the release of Ruby applications (name comes from "Release + easy").
By configuring a {Releasy::Project} in your application's rakefile, Releasy can generate a number of Rake tasks for use
when there is a need to build, archive and/or deploy a new version of the application.

Releasy allows cross-platform releases, relying on OS X or Windows "wrappers" to act as templates.

* Releasy has been tested on Ruby 1.9.3 and 1.8.7 on Windows, Lubuntu and OS X. However, since this is an early version, please ensure that you double-check any releases created by Releasy before publishing them!

Installation
------------

    gem install releasy

Build types supported
----------------------

The project can build one or more release folders:

* `:source` - Plain source folder, which can be used by anyone with Ruby already installed.
* `:osx_app` - OS X application bundle (.app) build, requiring a pre-made Ruby OS X wrapper. Note that this only contains binary gems for Gosu, TexPlay and Chipmunk, but will work with applications using any other source gems.
* `:windows_folder` - A folder containing Ruby, application source files and an EXE to run them [creation on Windows only].
* `:windows_wrapped` - A folder containing Ruby, application source files and an EXE to run them, requiring a copy of a RubyInstaller archive [creation on OSX/Linux].
* `:windows_installer` - A regular Windows installer [creation on Windows only and requires InnoSetup to be installed].
* `:windows_standalone` - Standalone EXE file that self-extracts to a temporary directory - slower startup than the other Windows options [creation on Windows only].

Package types supported
-----------------------

Optionally, release folders can be packaged into an archive using one or more of:

* `:dmg` - OS X self-extractor (.dmg - requires `hdiutil` to be installed, so only available on OS X).
* `:exe` - Windows self-extractor (.exe - Includes a 7z decompression module, so not efficient for small releases).
* `:"7z"` - 7Zip format (.7z - Best compression).
* `:tar_bz2` - BZip2 tarball (.tar.bz2).
* `:tar_gz` - GZip tarball (.tar.gz).
* `:zip` - Standard zip format (.zip - Poor compression, but best compatibility).

Deploy types supported
----------------------

Optionally, packaged releases can be deployed using one or more of:

* `:github` - Upload to a Github project's downloads page.
* `:local` - Copy files locally, for example into a local web server or dropbox folder.
* `:rsync` - Upload to remote server with rsync (requires 'rsync' command be installed).

Example
-------

### Project's Rakefile

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'bundler/setup' # Releasy doesn't require that your application uses bundler, but it does make things easier.
    require 'releasy'
    require 'lib/my_application/version'

    #<<<
    Releasy::Project.new do
      name "My Application"
      version MyApplication::VERSION

      executable "bin/my_application.rbw"
      files `git ls-files`.split("\n")
      files.exclude '.gitignore'

      exposed_files ["README.html", "LICENSE.txt"]
      add_link "http://my_application.github.com", "My Application website"
      exclude_encoding

      # Create a variety of releases, for all platforms.
      add_build :osx_app do
        url "com.github.my_application"
        wrapper "../osx_app/gosu-mac-wrapper-0.7.41.tar.gz"
        icon "media/icon.icns"
        add_package :tar_gz
      end

      add_build :source do
        add_package :zip
      end

      add_build :windows_folder do
        icon "media/icon.ico"
        add_package :exe
      end

      add_build :windows_installer do
        icon "media/icon.ico"
        start_menu_group "Spooner Games"
        readme "README.html" # User asked if they want to view readme after install.
        license "LICENSE.txt" # User asked to read this and confirm before installing.
        add_package :zip
      end

      add_deploy :github # Upload to a github project.
    end
    #>>>

### Tasks created

Note: The `windows:folder`, `windows:installer` and `windows:standalone` will be created only if running on Windows.
The `windows:wrapped` task will not be created if running on Windows.

    rake build                                # Build My Application 1.4.0
    rake build:osx                            # Build all osx
    rake build:osx:app                        # Build OS X app
    rake build:source                         # Build source
    rake build:windows                        # Build all windows
    rake build:windows:folder                 # Build windows folder
    rake build:windows:installer              # Build windows installer
    rake deploy                               # Deploy My Application 1.4.0
    rake deploy:osx:app:tar_gz:github         # github <= osx app .tar.gz
    rake deploy:source:zip:github             # github <= source .zip
    rake deploy:windows:folder:exe:github     # github <= windows folder .exe
    rake deploy:windows:installer:exe:github  # github <= windows installer .zip
    rake generate:images                      # Generate images
    rake package                              # Package My Application 1.4.0
    rake package:osx:app:tar_gz               # Package osx app .tar.gz
    rake package:source:zip                   # Package source .zip
    rake package:windows:folder:exe           # Package windows folder .exe
    rake package:windows:installer:zip        # Package windows installer .zip

A variety of unlisted tasks are also created, that allow for more control, such as `deploy:github` (Deploy all packages to Github only),
`deploy:windows:folder` (deploy all windows folder packages all destinations) or `package:windows` (Package all windows builds).

CLI Commands
------------

Releasy also provides some supplementary commands:

* `releasy install-sfx [options]` - Installs a copy of the Windows self-extractor in the local 7z installation, to allow use of the `:exe` archive format (it comes with the Windows version of 7z, so only need to use this command on OS X/Linux).


External Requirements
---------------------

### 7-Zip

The [7z](http://www.7-zip.org) command must be installed on your system for Releasy to work:

  - Installing on OS X homebrew:

    <pre>brew install p7zip</pre>

  - Installing on Ubuntu/Debian:

    <pre>sudo apt-get install p7zip-full</pre>

  - Installing on Windows (or other OS)

    * [Download 7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) - Either the full version or the command line version will work with Releasy.

### To build `:windows_installer` release (Windows only)

[InnoSetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) is used to create an installer for the application.

### To build `:windows_wrapped` release (OS X/Linux)

[RubyInstaller 7-ZIP archives](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) for Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 or 1.9.3. Used as a wrapper for a Windows release built on non-Windows systems.

### To build `:osx_app` application bundle release (any platform)

[libgosu app wrapper](http://www.libgosu.org/downloads/). Latest version of the OS X-compatible wrapper is "gosu-mac-wrapper-0.7.41.tar.gz" which uses Ruby 1.9.2 and includes some binary gems: Gosu, Chipmunk and TexPlay.
